<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Alejandra Montejo 🌍🧑‍🔬</h1>
<h3 align="center">Air Quality Researcher & Atmospheric Modeling Specialist 📡🌫️</h3>

<p align="center">

👋 **Welcome to my GitHub Profile!**  
I am a passionate researcher focused on atmospheric chemistry, air quality modeling, and climate change. My work revolves around analyzing anthropogenic emissions, monitoring pollutants, and implementing models like WRF-Chem to understand air pollution dynamics in urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>🚀 <strong>Professional Journey</strong></summary>
  <p>
    I am a researcher in the Air Quality Group at Universidad de los Andes and the leader of the Air Quality Governance Strategy in Bogotá's Environmental Secretariat. I have worked on atmospheric modeling projects, personal exposure to pollutants, and environmental governance.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have experience working in both the <strong>public and private sectors</strong>, contributing to air quality policies, environmental governance frameworks, and technological advancements for pollution monitoring. In the <strong>public sector</strong>, I have collaborated with governmental institutions to design and implement regulatory frameworks for air quality management. In the <strong>private sector</strong>, I have worked with environmental consultancies and research organizations to develop innovative solutions for emissions monitoring and control.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I develop citizen monitoring strategies and collaborative sensor networks to enhance public engagement and communication on air quality issues.

  <summary>📊 <strong>Air Quality in Bogotá & Medellín</strong></summary>
  <p>
    My experience working with air quality data in <strong>Bogotá and Medellín</strong> has shown how <strong>external contributions significantly influence local air pollution levels</strong>. The following graph illustrates monthly average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in both cities, highlighting seasonal variations and long-term trends:
